ISSUE: 429 Too Many Requests - Rate Limit Exceeded

Console Output:

POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login 429 (Too Many Requests)

Error Details:
❌ Response error: 429 /auth/login
XHR failed loading: POST "http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login"

Root Cause:
-----------
The backend rate limiter blocked the login attempt after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes.
This is a security feature to prevent brute force attacks.

Solution Applied:
-----------------
1. Updated rate limits in development environment:
   - Login: 50 attempts per 15 minutes (was 5)
   - Register: 20 attempts per hour (was 3)

2. File modified: backend/src/middlewares/rateLimit.middleware.ts
   - Added environment-aware rate limiting
   - Production limits remain strict for security

Next Steps:
-----------
1. Restart the backend server to reset the rate limiter
2. Try logging in again
3. Monitor console for successful token storage logs
